## Abstract
Early identification of depression in university students remains challenging due to multidimensional contributing factors spanning academic, lifestyle, and socioeconomic domains. This study applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify compound risk factors that predict depression more effectively than individual variables alone, analyzing a secondary dataset of 27,900 Indian university students across 13 standardized variables including academic pressure, financial stress, sleep duration, and suicidal ideation.
PCA was used to reveal principal components as directions of maximal variance. Component loadings were analyzed to interpret factor composition, and Pearson correlation quantified relationships with depression status. Linear regression modeling assessed predictive strength of the most correlated component.
Results demonstrate that depression emerges from multiple semi-independent pathways rather than a single dominant factor. Notably, the 2nd principal component exhibits exceptional predictive power: loading heavily on academic pressure (0.451), financial stress (0.438), and suicidal thoughts (0.437), it achieves a correlation of r = -0.707 (R² = 0.50) with depression. This compound factor explains approximately 50% of variance in depression status, substantially exceeding any individual predictor (typically R² ≈ 0.25-0.30) and demonstrating that these stressors operate synergistically rather than additively.
These findings suggest PCA-derived compound factors offer superior predictive validity for depression screening in educational settings, though the diffuse variance structure indicates depression’s complex, multi-pathway etiology cannot be reduced to fewer than ~9 dimensions without information loss.
